DoorfooD Project 🍔🍕
DoorfooD is a food ordering and recommendation system built with Flask, MongoDB, and machine learning techniques. It provides users with personalized food recommendations based on their past orders using a hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

This README will guide you through the content, setup, and installation for the DoorfooD project.

Overview 📊
The DoorfooD project provides an API that allows users to get personalized food recommendations based on their previous orders. The backend is built using Flask, with MongoDB for data storage, and the recommendation engine uses machine learning to suggest relevant food items.

Key Features ✨

Feature	Description	Icon
Hybrid Recommendation System	Combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering	🔄

API Endpoints 🚀
/recommend: Provides personalized food recommendations based on user’s previous orders.

/: A simple health check endpoint to ensure the API is running.

Project Structure 📂
Backend (Flask Application)

File	Description
app.py	Main Flask application file, handling API routes and logic
recommend()	Endpoint to generate food recommendations using hybrid filtering

Installation ⚙️
Server Setup 🖥️
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/irfan7mi/doorfood.git
Navigate into the project directory:
cd doorfood

Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up MongoDB URI:
Ensure that your .env file contains the following environment variables:
